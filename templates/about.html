  <h2>How it works</h2>
  
  <p>During a live show, voting buttons will appear on the <a href="#vote">Vote</a> tab.</p>
    
  <p>You can award up to 12 points to each act.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Voting takes place during each performance.</strong> Voting for each entry opens when each act starts performing and closes when they complete their performance. Don't miss an act or you won't be able to vote for them.</p>
    
  <p>You can see an average of the points awarded to each entry on the <a href="#scores">Scores</a> tab. The winner of this year's Scorecard home vote is the entry with the highest average points.</p>
